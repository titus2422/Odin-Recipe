    <h4>A Easy Formula For The Best Vegan Lasagna</h4>
    <p>
      Many vegan lasagna recipes contain a laundry list of ingredients. This one
      uses as few as possible without sacrificing flavor. Instead of making
      every component from scratch, you’ll make a homemade vegan béchamel but
      opt for store-bought noodles and marinara. Most dry pasta and jarred
      marinara sauces are naturally vegan, but double-check the ingredient lists
      to be sure there’s no egg in the pasta or cheese in the sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Béchamel is the creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk found
      in traditional lasagna recipes. The homemade cashew cream used in this
      recipe has a similar richness, making it a great vegan substitute.
      <strong>
        Remember: You’ll need to soak the cashews in water overnight to soften
        them before blending them into a sauce, so plan ahead.</strong

    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p><em>For the cashew bechamel:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cups raw, unsalted cashews</li>
      <li>5 cups water, divided</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>For the lasagna:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano leaves, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
      <li>1 (5-ounce) bag baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)</li>
      <li>
        1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar vegan marinara sauce (3 cups), such as Rao’s
      </li>
      <li>
        15 vegan dry lasagna noodles (about 12 ounces, not no-boil), such as De
        Cecco
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
      <li>Chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><em>Make the cashew béchamel: </em></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the cashews in a medium bowl and add 4 cups of the water. Soak
        uncovered at room temperature for 10 to 12 hours. The cashews are ready
        when they break apart when pressed between two fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the soaking water from the cashews. (Soaking pulls out the
        cashew’s phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors, making the sauce easier to
        digest, but leaving a less-than-tasty liquid after the long soak.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the drained cashews, remaining 1 cup water, garlic, and salt in a
        blender or food processor. Blend on high speed or process until
        completely smooth, 1 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the jar or
        bowl and blend or process again for 1 minute. Set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><em> Make the lasagna:</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375°F.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, heat the oil in
        a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and
        sauté until translucent and softened, about 5 minutes. Add the
        mushrooms, 1 teaspoon of the oregano, salt, and red pepper flakes, if
        desired, and sauté until tender and most of the released liquid is
        evaporated, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the spinach and stir until just wilted,
        1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the water is boiling, add the lasagna noodles and cook, stirring
        frequently, until just barely al dente, about 4 minutes or according to
        package instructions. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about 1/4 cup of the marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Lay 4 noodles in a single layer over the sauce (it's OK if
        the noodles overlap slightly). Spread 1 cup of marinara sauce over the
        noodles, then dollop with half the cashew béchamel sauce. Top with half
        of the vegetable mixture. Repeat the layers: 4 noodles, 1 cup marinara
        sauce, remaining cashew béchamel, and remaining vegetable mixture. Top
        with the remaining noodles. Spread the remaining marinara sauce over the
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle
        with the nutritional yeast if desired, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1
        teaspoon oregano, chopped parsley, and red pepper flakes if desired
        before serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
