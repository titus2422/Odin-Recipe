    <h3>Sheet Pan Mac and Cheese with Brussels Sprouts</h3>

    <p>
      Now that it’s fall and I can crank up my oven without sweating, I’ve been
      roasting a lot of vegetables. But instead of making them play second
      fiddle as a side, I’ve been mixing them into farro, rice, and, yes, all
      sorts of pasta, creating a satisfying main dish that’s packed with
      flavorful veggies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, I’m sharing my favorite iteration: sheet pan mac and cheese with
      Brussels sprouts. You’ll cook the noodles and make the cheese sauce while
      the veggies roast, then mix everything together, return it to the sheet
      pan, and pop it under the broiler until every bite is crispy-creamy. It’s
      the ultimate mash-up of two of my favorite foods — and my only regret is I
      didn’t think of it sooner.

    <h4>3 Reasons To Love This Sheet Pan Pasta!</h4>

    <p>Try it once and you'll be converted forever. Here's why.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>It’s quicker-cooking.</strong> Broiling the cheesy pasta rather
        than baking it significantly cuts down on cook time. Plus, you’ll spread
        everything onto the sheet pan used for the Brussels sprouts, reducing
        the amount of dirty dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> It boasts a better ratio of topping to noodles:</strong> By
        increasing the surface area of the mac and cheese and covering it in a
        generous layer of breadcrumbs, you get way more crispy topping in every
        bite. The tops of the curly noodles get a little crunchy under the
        broiler, too — my personal favorite part.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> It’s endlessly versatile.</strong> You can switch up
        practically every component of this recipe to create a new dish every
        week. Swap the Brussels sprouts for broccoli or butternut squash; try
        fluted campanelle in place of the cavatappi; swap in fontina for the
        cheddar or Gruyère; and even use Goldfish or Ritz crackers in place of
        the panko.

    </ol>
